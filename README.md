This is the repository for paper ***Discovering Financial Hypernyms by Prompting Masked Language Model***.

Please download FinBERT from https://github.com/yya518/FinBERT

We merged the two-word hypernyms (credit index and equity index) to hypernym ***index***, please see details in Merge2Index.py.
